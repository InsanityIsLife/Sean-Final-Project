               Bane Legends is a tribute to one of the most fascinating sith in the Star Wars universe.
               Darth Bane's journey, from his rise to power, to his pivotal role in shaping the Sith, has always captivated me.
               The Bane books were a huge part of my introduction to the expanded Star Wars universe. His story is not just a tale of dark power but a complex narrative of ambition, strategy, and transformation.
