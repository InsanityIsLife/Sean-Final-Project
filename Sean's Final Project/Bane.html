        <section id="about">
           <p class="para1"> 
            Known primarily for his role in reshaping the Sith Order. His real name was Dessel, a miner on the planet Apatros. 
            Born into harsh conditions, Dessel's early life was marked by struggle and hardship, which fueled his desire for power. 
            His journey into the dark side began when he left his life of labor to join the Sith Order, where he adopted the name Darth Bane.

            <p class="para2">
                Bane's most significant contribution to the Sith was the creation of the Rule of Two, a doctrine that fundamentally altered Sith philosophy. 
                Prior to Bane, the Sith were plagued by infighting and a lack of unified purpose. Bane believed that this constant strife prevented the Sith from ever challenging the Jedi effectively. 
                His <a href="RuleofTwo.html"><em>Rule of Two</em></a> dictated that there would always only ever be a master and an apprentice.
                This principle was designed to ensure that the Sith would be stronger and more focused, with each generation learning from the last.
                </p>
            <p class="para3">
                Under Bane's leadership, the Sith Order went underground, operating in secrecy while plotting their return. 
                His influence lasted long after his death, as his Rule of Two became the foundation of Sith strategy for a millennium. 
                Bane's legacy was felt across the galaxy, shaping the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi and leaving an indelible mark on the Star Wars saga.
