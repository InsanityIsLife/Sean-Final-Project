                The Rule of Two is a central doctrine in Sith philosophy, established by Darth Bane to address the systemic issues that plagued the Sith Order prior to his reforms. 
                It stipulates that there should always be only two Sith at any given time: a master and an apprentice. 
                This paradigm is meant to ensure that the Sith remain strong, focused, and capable of achieving their ultimate goals.
                </p>
            <p class="para2">
                Before Bane's reform, the Sith Order was characterized by a multitude of Sith lords vying for power, leading to constant internal conflict and instability. 
                This chaotic structure resulted in numerous power struggles and frequent betrayals, which weakened the Sith and prevented them from mounting a coherent and unified challenge to the Jedi. 
                Bane recognized that this infighting was detrimental to the Sith's long-term survival and effectiveness. 
                He believed that a more streamlined and disciplined approach was necessary for the Sith to achieve their ultimate aim of galactic domination.
               </p>
            <p class="para3">
                By instituting the Rule of Two, Bane aimed to create a more effective and dangerous Sith Order. 
                The master is tasked with imparting knowledge and ensuring that the Sith's power grows, while the apprentice serves as a potential successor, always striving to surpass the master. 
                This dynamic fosters a continual drive for improvement and ambition within the Sith ranks. The apprentice, driven by the desire to become the master, inherently becomes a formidable threat, ensuring that the Sith remain ever-vigilant and potent. 
                This approach was designed to allow the Sith to operate in secrecy while meticulously planning their resurgence and eventual domination, thus creating a more disciplined and strategically sound order.
